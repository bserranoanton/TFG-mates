	abstract = "We formulate and analyze an algorithm of cell fate decision that describes the way in which division vs. apoptosis choices are made by individual T cells during an infection. Such model involves a minimal number of known biochemical mechanisms: it basically relies on the interplay between cell division and cell death inhibitors on one hand, and membrane receptors on the other. In spite of its simplicity, the proposed decision algorithm is able to account for some significant facts in immune response. At the individual level, the existence of T cells that continue to replicate in the absence of antigen and the possible occurrence of T cell apoptosis in the presence of antigen are predicted by the model. Moreover, the latter is shown to yield an emergent collective behavior, the observed delay in clonal contraction with respect to the end of antigen stimulation, which is shown to arise just from individual T cell decisions made according to the proposed mechanism."

How lymphocytes integrate receptor-mediated signals influencing these cell fates is a fundamental question for understanding this complex system. We examined how lymphocytes interleave times to divide and die to develop a mathematical model of lymphocyte growth regulation. This model provides a powerful method for fitting and analyzing fluorescent division tracking data and reveals how summing receptor-mediated kinetic changes can modify the immune response progressively from rapid tolerance induction to strong immunity. An important consequence of our results is that intrinsic variability in otherwise identical cells, usually dismissed as noise, may have evolved to be an essential feature of immune regulation.},

Recent experimental methodologies enable direct observation of individual lymphocytes and the times at which they adopt fates. Data from these experiments reveal diversity in fate selection, heterogeneity and involved correlation structures in times to fate, as well as considerable familial correlations. Despite the significant complexity, these data are consistent with the simple hypothesis that each cell possesses autonomous processes, subject to temporal competition, leading to each fate. This article addresses the evidence for this hypothesis, its hallmarks, and, should it be an appropriate description of a cell system, its ramifications for manipulation."

I will then point out the distinction between forward and reverse modeling and focus thereafter on the former. Instead of going into mathematical technicalities about different varieties of models, I will focus on their logical structure, in terms of assumptions and conclusions. A model is a logical machine for deducing the latter from the former. If the model is correct, then, if you believe its assumptions, you must, as a matter of logic, also believe its conclusions. This leads to consideration of the assumptions underlying models. If these are based on fundamental physical laws, then it may be reasonable to treat the model as ‘predictive’, in the sense that it is not subject to falsification and we can rely on its conclusions. However, at the molecular level, models are more often derived from phenomenology and guesswork. In this case, the model is a test of its assumptions and must be falsifiable. I will discuss three models from this perspective, each of which yields biological insights, and this will lead to some guidelines for prospective model builders."

In their native environment, T cells achieved peak velocities of more than 25 micrometers per minute, displaying a motility coefficient that is five to six times that of B cells.

We observed immunological synapse formation and prolonged interactions between these two cell types, followed by the activation, dissociation, and rapid migration of T cells away from the antigenic stimulus.

	abstract = {Chronic infections are a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide and are often associated with CD8 T cell exhaustion. T cell dysfunction in these settings is likely a major reason for failed control of infection. In many chronic infections, CD4 T cells are also of major importance (e.g., HIV, HCV and LCMV). Compared to CD8 T cells, however, there is relatively little information on dysfunction of virus-specific CD4 T cell responses. This prompted us to ask whether CD4 T cells also become dysfunctional and how the differentiation of virus-specific CD4 T cells during chronic viral infection compares to CD8 T cells. We have defined the pattern of differentiation, hierarchy of dysfunction and diversity of costimulatory and inhibitory pathways involved in CD4 T cells exhaustion by comparing responses during acute and chronic LCMV infection. The results show that while CD4 T cells do become exhausted, they do not follow the exhaustive profile that has been established for CD8 T cells. While CD4 T cells do upregulate multiple inhibitory receptors during chronic infection, the inhibitory receptors they upregulate and their expression profile differs from CD8 T cells. These studies highlight that the well-characterized phenotype of CD8 T cell exhaustion cannot be broadly applied to CD4 T cells and suggests that CD4 and CD8 T cells may require different therapeutic treatments to rescue exhaustion.},
